# Pitch Sequences that Lead to Strike Outs

## Intro
The essence of baseball can be described by the duel between the pitcher and the batter. When the batter wins, they get on base, drive in runs, or hit a home run. For the picther, the currency is an out. Some pitchers rely on their defense by giving up contact but still getting outs. However, the most lauded arms get their outs by striking out batters. Pitchers who get strikeouts use a wide breadth of methods, but to keep it simple, this study breaks them down into the following categories: (a) flame-throwers: pitchers who use the fastball to blow their picthes by batters, (b) junk throwers: these arms use less velocity but more use movement to punch hitters out, and (c) crafty hybrids: throwers who utilize both heat and junk to get strike three. 

In case you stumbled on this post with little or knowledge of baseball, I recommend that you read this [post](http://dearsportsfan.com/2014/10/24/different-kinds-pitchers-baseball/#:~:text=%20Pitchers%20classified%20by%20throwing%20motion%20%201,League%20Baseball%20throw%20with%20the%20same...%20More%20) by Ezra Fischer and this [post](https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Pitches) by baseball-reference to get a basic understanding of picthing at pitch types so that the data makes more sense. I would also recommend reading ["How Baseball Works"](https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/baseball1.htm) by Kevin Bonsor and Joe Martin to get a broader understanding of the fundamentals of baseball. 

For those more techinically inclined, Additionally, I read two publications that helped get a greater technical understanding of pitch sequence. Both are written about the Japanese baseball league, Nippon Professional Baseball. The first [paper](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=616064002106074070126030116028120121037016025093044007014074021026002102074069114120028062030124045033010027077093090098122115046083078061083097069027065094116029094010018046069065068119097115065116098088127103069125113120103103098075074068097015123098&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE) written by Yoshiharra and Takahashi (2020) to examines "the relationship between pitch sequences and pitcher/hitter characteristics, game situations, and hitter reslts" with a topic model.  The other [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32182276/) written by Kidokoro and colleagues (2020) studied how the timing of a small set of high school batters was altered with varying pitch sequences and information about the incoming pitch.  

Back to the project, to understand how the sequence of pitches leads to a strikeout, I examined Major League Baseball (MLB) pitch-by-pitch [data](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018) that was kindly collected by Paul Schale on Kaggle ([pschale)](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale)). 

This notebook is reflects a portion of a three part series to undestand how picth sequences affect picther and batter productivity. **In this first portion of the series, I explore and classify pitching sequences that lead to strikeouts in the 2015 to 2018 MLB regular seasons.**

## Getting familar with the data
_For explanation of variable names, please see Kaggle dataset or read the informational part of this [post](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/491386_ba16153bbd1749a6a0698df6a83b88b2.html) by Brandon Lester_\
After examining the available data with an internt browser on the Kaggle website, it is clear that the dataset is quite granular, tracks every pitch thrown and labels each one with an "at bat" ID (ab_id). Therefore it makes sense to organize pitches by their ID (which conveniently includes the season).
