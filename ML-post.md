# Multi-Label Classification w/ Machine Learning - pitch-sequence

## Classifying Baseball Events
Top-line objective: *Using an assortment of pitching information, how well can we predict the specific outcome of an at-bat?*

This post is a part of a two-part series in which the MLB Pitch dataset is explored and used to learn ML classification techniques. See [pitch-sequence repo](https://github.com/907Resident/pitch-sequence) for more details.

## Preface
As an awardee of the [Kaggle BIPOC Program](https://www.kaggle.com/bipoc-grant-application), I had the opportunity to select a project that interested me and work on it directly with an established Machine Learning Engineer. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and would recommend others who satisfy the criteria for the program to apply in the future. I will say that it is tough to get all of what you want completed when you are also trying to finish a dissertation and start a new job. But I believe the following is a good synposis of how one can put ML to work through this program. 

## Introduction
About 730k pitches are thrown in Major League Baseball (MLB) every season. Thanks to [Paul Schale](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale), a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018?select=2019_pitches.csv) of these picthes from the 2015-2019 seasons has been produced for all to access on Kaggle.
